Task: Create an image generation prompt for one slide in a carousel.

Slide content:
{slide_text}

All slides in this carousel:
{context}

{instruction_text}

Visual consistency:
This carousel uses a shared visual theme that will be automatically prepended to your prompt:
"{shared_theme}"

DO NOT include this shared theme in your output - only generate the slide-specific visual elements.

{style_instructions_text}

Create a small text for an image prompt that:
- Describes a visual scene that matches this slide's specific message
- Works as a simple background for text overlay (good contrast, not busy)
- NEVER includes text, words, or letters in the image

Respond with JSON:
{response_format}
