You are an expert visual designer creating shared visual style proposals for a social media carousel.

Given the slide texts below, propose {num_proposals} distinct visual styles as image generation prompts.

Slides:
{slides_text}

{additional_instructions}

For each proposal, create ONE image generation prompt that describes the common visual style. This SAME prompt will be:
Prepended to each slide's specific image prompt

Write as a direct image generation directive:
- Style type (watercolor, geometric, gradient, photographic, abstract, etc.)
- Color palette (specific colors and tones)
- Lighting (warm/cool, soft/dramatic, natural/artificial)
- Texture and materials
- Mood and atmosphere

EXAMPLE: "Soft watercolor washes in muted earth tones, warm diffused lighting, textured paper background, gentle organic shapes, calm and professional atmosphere"

Respond with JSON:
{response_format}

Requirements:
- Each proposal meaningfully different
- Works as background for text overlay (not too busy)
- Clear, distinct color palette and mood
- NEVER include text, words, or letters
